# Browser Security Handbook #

_Browser Security Handbook_ is meant to provide web application developers, browser engineers, and information security researchers with a one-stop reference to key security properties of contemporary web browsers. Insufficient understanding of these often poorly-documented characteristics is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of several classes of security vulnerabilities.

The document currently covers several hundred security-relevant characteristics of [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx) (versions 6, 7, and 8), [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) (versions 2 and 3), [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), and [Android embedded browser](http://www.android.com/).

Open-source test cases provided alongside with this document permit any other browser implementations to be quickly evaluated in a similar manner.

_**Note that a more complete and up-to-date account of the browser security model, including a detailed coverage of topics such as HTML parsing, JS execution, plugin capabilities, frame navigation policies, or HTML5 security, can be found in ["The Tangled Web"](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/).**_
